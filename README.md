# Fit-Culture-an-ecommerce-gym-website
A portal was being created for gym freaks to buy gym products and other gym equipment for achieving fitness. Users can view the products that they want to buy. They can even add their products to the Favorite List. Users can view and filter their products as per their categories. The website was created using MERN Stack. React-redux as the frontend and node(express) as the backend. Cloudinary, a 3rd party cloud server, was used for file handling purposes.
